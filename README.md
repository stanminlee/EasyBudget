# EasyBudget
I made a budgeting application with unique user authentication. You can input your monthly income and list expenses, and you will receive some basic suggestions based on your input. I am currently working to add more features, such as monthly tracking to see your progress, better data visualization like graphs, a more aesthetically pleasing user interface, and more advanced suggestions! I learned how to integrate a user interface with a functional backend and database. I am excited to continue working on this project and improve my skills.

# Requirements
You will need flask, flask-login, and SQLAlchemy to run this project.
To launch the project, run the "main.py" file and access your local host address on port 8000.

I mainly used python and html, but there are elements of SQL, CSS, and Javascript mixed in as well.
